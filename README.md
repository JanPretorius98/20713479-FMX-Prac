##  Installation

The project makes use of the following packages, that can be loaded with the external script `libraries.R` (see `UTILITIES` below):
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyverse
- stringr
- tidytext
- readxl

These libraries are loaded using the pacman package, which offers a more convenient way to load R packages, installing them if necessary. Ensure that pacman is installed on your machine by running the following code in R:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}

```
